# 1. Introduction
For my term project, I needed to collect reviews of musicals in South Korea. That the reason why I crawled reviews from Interpart, South Korea's one of the most famous musical ticket seller site. 
# 2. Basic information & site access
I used BeautifulSoup selenium and time.
```python
from bs4 import BeautiulSoup
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time
```
Also, becuase of the convenience of extending sites pages, selenium is setted to view mobile version of the site. 
```python
mobile_emulation = { "deviceName": "iPhone X" }
chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
chrome_options.add_experimental_option("mobileEmulation", mobile_emulation)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
```
And to access site, **get** is used to access site and **time.sleep** lets waiting for further process. Waiting time is needed to give selenium driver time to get data from site. If it could not get data from site, next process could not proceed well. 
```python
site = 'http://mticket.interpark.com/genre?Genre=MU'
driver.get(site)
time.sleep(1)
```
# 3. Set sorting option of site to descending number of reviews
Interpark offers search options for sorting musical by descending order of number of reviews of them. And I want to use it to list musicals by that order. This is done by below code.
```python
try:
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"/html/body/main/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/button/span").click()
    time.sleep(0.5)
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"/html/body/main/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div/ul/li[2]/input").click()
except:
    print("Error in Musical list page sort selection")
```
If error occurs on code under **try**, code under **except** will be runned. The **find_element(By.XPATH, <span style="color:blue">XPATH</span>)** gets the element in the given **<span style="color:blue">XPATH</span>** and **click()** makes event click on that element. <br>First XPATH is **<span style="color:blue">XPATH</span>** of button that opens sorting option lists. And second XPATH is **<span style="color:blue">XPATH</span>** of the sorting by the number of reiews.
# 4. Make list of musicals with accessible reviews
From the sorted list of musicals, I got address of each musicals ticketing site. But some are not showed at first page. Therefore, I used below code to extend list of musicals. 
```python
while True:
    try:
        # Get scroll height
        last_height = driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
        while True:
            # Scroll down to bottom
            driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")
            # Wait to load page
            time.sleep(0.7)
            # Calculate new scroll height and compare with last scroll height
            new_height = driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
            if new_height == last_height:
                break
            last_height = new_height
            
        check = driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"/html/body/main/div[3]/div[2]")
        # check existance of extend button
        if check.get_attribute("style") == "display: none;": break
        # click button
        check.click()
        time.sleep(0.5)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        pass
```
And each muscials ticketing page address is saved in addresslist by below code.
```python
addresslist = []
i = 0
while True:
    i += 1
    try:
        elem = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "/html/body/main/div[3]/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/ul/li["+str(i)+"]/a").get_attribute("href")
        addresslist.append(elem)
    except:
        break
```
# What will be done next
By using the address gained, reviews of each musical will gathered in next post.
